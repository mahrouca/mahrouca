## Hi, Iâ€™m Amina! ðŸ‘‹

I am a spacecraft control engineer with a passion for control theory. I have a BS in aerospace engineering and currently finishing up an MS degree in aerospace engineering, dynamics, and control. Long term, I plan to get a Ph.D. in astrodynamics and satellite navigation focused on optimizing algorithms to achieve fully autonomous spacecraft attitude determination and control (maybe orbit, too). Aside from aerospace, I enjoy diving into nonverbal communication, psychology, software and computer science skills (i.e., automation to mitigate mundane tasks), and data mining/visualization.
